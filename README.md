# Tic-Tac-Toe
A basic Tic Tac Toe game.

You will be shown a grid with 9 numbers.


You have to enter a number between 1 and 9 in that grid to input your choice.


When you a enter a number that number will be swapped with X if you are player 1 and O if you are player to.

Completing a row column or diagonal will win you the game.

#UPDATE
Fixed a bug where one of the win conditions was not working.
